What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
- The problem I was trying to solve was how to organize a set of data for school courses via a binary search tree.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
- I approached it by looking at linkedlists, hash tables and BST's to figure out which one would be the best to use for this specific data set and I figued a bst would get the results the fastest due to its quick nature of combing through sets of data and organizing the data
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
- I used my textbook and I used sites like stack overflow to see if people had encountered the specific errors I was getting and how they went about fixing them 
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
- I did not know much about data sets before this course and I find them super interesting and fun to create now. I am looking forward to getting a 13,000 entry data set and figuring out how to best sort that data. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?# FinalDataStructures
- Making code that is easy to read, easy to maintain and easy to change is very important because in a workplace setting if your peers cannot read your code that is a huge issue and can cause the project to be prolonged because of that
